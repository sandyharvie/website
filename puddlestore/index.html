                <p> PuddleStore is a fault-tolerant, strongly consistent distributed file system that allows users to create, update, read, and delete files through a command-line interface. </p>

                <p> Based on the <a href="http://oceanstore.cs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/pdf/asplos00.pdf" target="_blank">OceanStore</a> project and written in Go, it uses <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache ZooKeeper</a> as a membership server, <a href="http://www.srhea.net/papers/tapestry_jsac.pdf" target="_blank">Tapestry</a> to store data blocks, and <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf" target="_blank">Raft</a> to commit changes. The <a href="https://grpc.io" target="_blank">gRPC</a> framework is used to facilitate client-server communication, as well as communication amongst Tapestry nodes and Raft nodes. </p>

                <p> PuddleStore utilizes a copy-on-write approach when modifying file system objects (files and directories). To facilitate this, file system objects are given a constant Active GUID (AGUID), which maps to a Version GUID (VGUID). The VGUID mapped to by the AGUID references the current version of a file system object which can be obtained through Tapestry. Raft maintains these mappings, thus ensuring that modifications to the file system occur in a causal and total order from the perspective of the client. </p>

                <p> The Apache ZooKeeper membership server allows for PuddleStore to accomodate the scalability of the underlying Tapestry and Raft systems and balance client requests across these systems. Upon starting up, Raft and Tapestry nodes register with the membership server. The PuddleStore server is then able to retrieve references to Raft and Tapestry nodes from this membership server when fulfilling client requests. </p>
