                    <p> Nice to meet you. </p>

                    <p> I'm currently a junior at Brown University studying computer science. I'm interested in all things software, but my primary interests lie in systems programming and distributed computing. </p>

                    <p> This past summer, I worked at <a href="https://www.blend.com" target="_blank">Blend</a> as a software engineering intern on the Lending Platform and New Business Initiatives teams. As a member of the Lending Platform team, I contributed to Blend's shift to a multi-tenant deployment architecture, refactored its use of Amazon SQS to allow for the consolidation of low-priority workers, and optimized its data purge job. As a member of the New Business Initiatives team, I worked across the stack to develop and ship support for HELOCs, the first new loan type to be added to Blend's platform. </p>

                    <p> The summer before last, I worked at <a href="https://www.ncta.com" target="_blank">NCTA</a> as a software engineering intern. As part of the team working on NCTA's <a href="https://www.atlas.ripe.net" target="_blank">RIPE Atlas</a> Internet Measurement Project, I developed an internal web application composed of interactive visualizations of streaming data for network performance, outages, and interconnection.</p>
